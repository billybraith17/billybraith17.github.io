I am a recent graduate of the MSc in Mathematical Modelling and Scientific Computing at the University of Oxford. My website highlights some of my personal and academic projects.

## Projects
Here are some of my projects. I've provided a brief summary and linked the reports I wrote for each of them.

- [**Alternative Methods to Determine the Role of Hidden Layer Neurons in the Generative Model.**](docs/Diss-final.pdf) Research project in collaboration with Amazon. We adapted a novel machine learning technique, which had previously only been applied to image classification and generation networks, to audio generation networks. This involved the integration and development of Python packages, the adaptation of theory and the creation of innovative new ways to test our theories.

- [**Numerical Solutions of Differential Equations Using Neural Networks.**](docs/Computing_case_study-final.pdf) Investigating convergence rates of the polynomial approximation to different classes of continuous functions. We review theorems for continuously differentiable functions and analytic functions. We then investigate $$C^{\infty}$$ nowehere analytic functions. We derive some new theoretical bounds on a subclass of these niche functions and verify our bounds computationally using Matlab.

- [**Implementing Finite Difference Schemes and GMRES to Solve Poisson's Equation in One, Two and Three Dimensions.**](docs/C___project-final.pdf) We investigate various analogues of the Erdős–Rényi random network for simplicial complexes. We derive the degree distributions for one particular generalisation of the ER graph and verify it numerically. We then investigate the importance of higher order interactions by building SIR models on our random simplicial complexes and compare results to the case for graphs. Computations done using the NetworkX Python library.

- [**Modelling RNA Velocity and Gene Regulatory Networks with Neural Networks.**](docs/Modelling_case_study-final.pdf) We use functional analysis and optimisation to recolour grey-scale images given colour information at a small number of pixels. We investigate the impact of different parameters in the colour recovery process. 

- [**Exploring the Computational Properties of Infinite Width Neural Networks.**](docs/final-draft.pdf) We program a matrix class in C++. Operators have been overloaded to allow for robust, Matlab-like functionality. We implement Gaussian elimination, GMRES, QR and other numerical linear algebra algorithms. We verify our implementations by solving PDEs using the finite element method. 

- [**An in-Depth Look at Modularity Methods for Community Detection.**](docs/Networks_project-final.pdf) We investigate two different theories which model the growth of neurons in the brain. We build a coupled model which agrees with both theories in their respective regimes. We provide analytic solutions to the coupled model in a simplified case, and numerical solutions for the full PDE.
